# Similarity between Genres using Natural Language Processing

## Key Terms:
**Blurb:** A blurb is a short description of a book, film, or other product written for promotional purposes.

**Genre:** A style or category of literature. In this repository genre is used interchangeably with category of books. This is an EDA done on the data gotten from scraping okadabooks, an e-book store. More details on the webcrawler [here](https://github.com/EdidiongEsu/okadabooks_scraper). 

Okadabooks is a popular online store for african literature, based in Nigeria. Since the company was founded in 2013, it has helped increase the reading culture in the country and pioneered a lot of writing initiatives. For more info, check the [website](https://okadabooks.com.).

## Aim:
In this repository I tried to answer some questions:
- Are blurbs accurate representation of books?
- Can blurbs be used to differentiate categories of books?
- Similarities between different genres of books/novels usinmg Natural Language Processing.

## Choosing the genres to be used for analysis
In okadabooks.com, there are 22 categories/genres of books. To increase my chances of having an accurate result, I choose genres with at least a total number of 100,000  words.
