       "29     Humphrey is about two main characters, a super hero called Humphrey and the Anti-Christ. The novel spans thousands of years and tells the story of the beginning of creation when Lucifer was an angel; how he was cast out of heaven and everything that leads up to him manifesting as the Anti-Christ. \\r\\r\\r\\r\\nIt also chronicles the life of Michael Omarion and how he transforms into his alter ego - Humphrey and his calling to face off with the Anti- Christ. His story starts in the very early part of the 20th century when his grandmother, Granata’s fiancé, Nwanze, has grand visions of what is coming in the 21st century and how a super hero will arrive to save the world and that superhero is Humphrey who would come from Granata’s linage. \\r\\r\\r\\r\\nShe goes through life looking out for this special child, from a young lady till she grows to become an older woman.

I could feel sweat gathering at my hairline, and I wished someone would turn on the air conditioning. Glancing around the room, I noticed a middle-aged woman flipping through a magazine. She gave me a quick smile, and I thought I detected a hint of commiseration in her expression.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "14792  Zainab was intelligent, beautiful, and ambitious. But unfortunately for her, she was born into a tribe that considered women to be a man’s play thing and slave. So at a very tender age and without any serious education, she was forced into early marriage to someone whom she barely knew. She got nothing but the inevitable divorce from that. The second marriage reduced her to a nervous wreck. But they say that ‘life begins at forty’. Yes! Hers began at forty.
